===============
A tool using [binrw](https://github.com/jam1garner/binrw) to read FFXIV data files. Mainly made to harvest the music
from the game files for personal consumption, since it takes time for the music to come out digitally.

Thanks to [XIV Dev Wiki](https://xiv.dev/data-files/sqpack) for assisting with reverse-engineering.

The name is just Final Fantasy XIV, except the words are synonyms, and the Roman numerals were thrown through a
Caesar Cipher.
